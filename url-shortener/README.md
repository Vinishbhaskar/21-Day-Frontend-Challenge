## Conclusion

Completing Day 6 of the 21-day frontend development challenge was an exciting experience.

The URL Shortener is a handy tool that allows users to shorten long URLs into concise and manageable links. 

Users can input long URLs into the app, and with a single click, the app generates a shortened version of the URL using the powerful Bitly API. This allows users to share and distribute shorter links without compromising functionality.
