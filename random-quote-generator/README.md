## 💡 Conclusion

Completing Day 2 of the 21-day frontend development challenge was an exciting experience. The Random Quote Generator allowed me to further enhance my skills in React and JavaScript. I learned how to use React's useState hook to manage state and dynamically update the generated quote. The project also provided an opportunity to practice component composition and implement key functionalities such as sharing quotes and copying them to the clipboard.
