# Day 1 - Todo Application using Local Storage in React

Welcome to Day 1 of the 21-Day Frontend Development Challenge! In this project, we will be building a Todo application using local storage in React. This application will allow users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with the added feature of data persistence using local storage.

## Features

- Add tasks: Enter a task in the input field and press enter to add it to the list.
- Complete tasks: Click on a task to mark it as complete.
- Delete tasks: Click on the delete icon to remove a task from the list.
- Data persistence: The tasks will be stored in the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist even after refreshing the page.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of React
