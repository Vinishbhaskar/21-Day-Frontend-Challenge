## Conclusion

Completing Day 7 of the 21-day frontend development challenge was an exciting experience.

The Image Gallery is a dynamic and interactive application that allows users to search and explore a wide variety of images.

Users can enter keywords in the search bar to find specific images. The application uses the Unsplash API to fetch a collection of relevant images based on the search query.
